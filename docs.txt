Face recognition:

OpenCV cascades: (A waterfall or series of waterfalls)
    - It breaks the problem of detecting faces into multiple  stages.
    - For each block block a very rough and quick test is done.
    - 30 to 50 stages may be considered.
    - Cascades is just a bunch of XML files.
    - Contains OpenCV data used to detect objects.
    - OpenCV comes with a number of built-in cascades for detecting everything from faces to eyes to hands to legs.

Install OpenCV to proceed to next steps

Step 1: 
        -Import OpenCV and write face detection code using haar cascades
        -Use webCam to detect in real time.

Step 2: 
        -Save cropped images in a another folder.
        -Create a function which saves when pressed s on the keyboard.
        
        def saveImage(img,userName,userId,imgId):
             Path("dataset/{}".format(userName)).mkdir(parents=True,exist_ok=True) // This choose the location of folder to store the images.


             cv2.imwrite("dataset/{}/{}_{}.jpg".format(userName,userId,imgId),img) // This species the naming and in which format the images to be saved.


Step 3:
        -Find ROI (region of interest)
        -Here ROI is only the face.
